# Ingress-Nginx
I've used this ingress controller for dozens, if not hundreds of k8s clusters over the years. Sadly, it's being retired.
See this [note](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/11/11/ingress-nginx-retirement/) for further information.

You should instead opt for [API Gateways](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/).
